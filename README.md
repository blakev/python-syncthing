```bash
$ pip install syncthing
```

## Getting Started

```python
from syncthing import Syncthing

API_KEY = "..."

s = Syncthing(API_KEY)

# name spaced by API endpoints
s.system.connections()

# supports GET/POST semantics
sync_errors = s.system.errors()
s.system.clear()

if sync_errors:
    for e in sync_errors:
        print(e)

# supports event long-polling
event_stream = s.events(limit=10)
for event in event_stream:
    # do something with `event`
    if event_stream.count > 100:
        event_stream.stop()
```

## Running Tests

The API doctests rely on the following function to run against your instance.
None of the "breaking" calls will be tested. You must set the following environment
variables otherwise all tests will fail.

```python
def _syncthing():
    KEY = os.getenv('SYNCTHING_API_KEY')
    HOST = os.getenv('SYNCTHING_HOST', '127.0.0.1')
    PORT = os.getenv('SYNCTHING_PORT', 8384)
    IS_HTTPS = bool(int(os.getenv('SYNCTHING_HTTPS', '0')))
    SSL_CERT_FILE = os.getenv('SYNCTHING_CERT_FILE')
    return Syncthing(KEY, HOST, PORT, 10.0, IS_HTTPS, SSL_CERT_FILE)
```
